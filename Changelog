- Fix nop out timer. If the timer wakes up at the exact same time we were
supposed to check the transport we mistakenly drop the connection.

open-iscsi-2.0-869.2
- Fix nop out interval. If we send a ping to test the connection, we set
the next timer for the ping timeout. If we get a response quickly and
the ping timeout is long we will miss recv tmo test intervals.

This is not fatal. It will only cause detection of connection errors to take
up to (2 * noop_timeout + noop_interval) seconds to detect problems instead of
(noop_timeout + noop_interval) seconds.
